# Cave-Game
name is a placeholder

# Description
It's just a game I'm making. It takes place in a cave I think. It's very basic right now.

# Controls
Z = Jump
C = Grab/Climb

# Known bugs
Wall jumping doesn't push you away from the wall

# Future plans
Make the player gain a charge while moving in a direction. If the player changes direction the charge is reset. The higher the charge the more midair jumps they have. If they are in midair the charge is locked.
